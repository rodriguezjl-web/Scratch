# Jasper the Frog Mage

## Description
This project assigns a random x and y velocity to the ball upon start up and upon clicking the ball. It then calculates the trajectory of the ball after bouncing by multiplying the corresponding velocity by -1. A function was added to spin the ball and change its direction after bouncing. This makes the illusion of movement more realistic. Jasper the frog was added to make the project more fun. Programming movement in this way allowed me learn skills which transfer directly over to game design. This project was made as an assignment for Havard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science Class.
