# Jasper the Frog Mage

## Description
This project assigns a random direction to a ball when ran and every time the ball strikes the edge of the screen, a function was integrated to ensure the balls velocity was constant using the pythagorean theorem and a seperate function was integrated to make the ball spin. This project was made as an assignment for Havard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science Class.
